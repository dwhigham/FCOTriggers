Auto_Server_Failover
 
Do you want to ensure your services are back up and running asap following an issue with your VM?
This plugin automatically starts a shutdown backup server when a “Live_Server” is shutdown, with no manual intervention required and also switches ‘tags’ to show which is now live and which is now backup or in need of maintenance.
 
Use Cases/Scenarios
 
Enables a backup server to start automatically, in the event of an issue with the primary server.
Allows for quick automated  start-up of existing servers.
Tags server for easy identification to resolve issue at a later date.
Switches tags so the backup server becomes tagged as ‘live’ and vice-versa.
